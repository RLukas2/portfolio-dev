## Description

This project implements a chat engine using the E2EE Signal Protocol in Go. It is designed to provide secure and private messaging capabilities.

> This project is a project in the course CS434 - Computer Security at the University of Science - VNU-HCM.

> This project is not production-ready and is intended for educational purposes only. It is not recommended to use this code in production environments without proper security audits and enhancements.

## Key Features

This chat engine implements the Signal Protocol for end-to-end encryption, providing:

- **End-to-End Encryption**: Messages are encrypted on the sender's device and decrypted only on the recipient's device
- **Forward Secrecy**: Each message uses a unique encryption key, ensuring past communications remain secure even if current keys are compromised
- **Double Ratchet Algorithm**: Combines the cryptographic ratchet and DH ratchet for enhanced security
- **Real-time Messaging**: WebSocket-based communication for instant message delivery
- **Terminal User Interface**: Clean, responsive TUI built with tview for cross-platform compatibility
- **User Management**: Online/offline status tracking and user discovery
- **Room-based Chat**: Support for both direct messages and group chat rooms

### Client Interface

The client provides a terminal-based user interface with the following features:

1. **Login Screen**: Enter username and server details
2. **Room List**: View and join available chat rooms
3. **User List**: See online/offline users and start direct messages
4. **Chat Interface**: Send and receive encrypted messages

### Navigation

- **Arrow Keys**: Navigate through lists and interface elements
- **Enter**: Select items or send messages
- **Escape**: Go back or exit input fields
- **Tab**: Switch between interface components
- **`s`**: Focus search fields (in Users views)
- **`` ` ``**: Switch between rooms and users view
