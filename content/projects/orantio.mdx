## Key Features

1. Group Messaging
   - Server Channel Conversations is the primary feature of our application, Orantio. A user can add, edit, or delete messages in a channel and reply to messages. Additionally, users can express their reactions using emojis, and upload images, videos, and other attachments with other users.
2. Online Presence
   - A user can know whenever other users are online. He/she can also share his/her status with other users by setting his/her custom status.
3. Multiple Device Support
   - The same account can be logged in to multiple accounts at the same time.
4. Server Management
   - The server owner can decide what other members in a server can do through the use of server roles & permissions. It is used when we want to categorize a set of users with predefined permissions (server role with admin permissions, or just basic permissions for a user to interact with components in the server freely).
   - The server owner can also restrict a user from a server by kicking a user out of a server or banning that user.
5. User Management
   - Enable user registration, login, and authentication to ensure secure access to the application.
   - A user can upload his/her avatar, edit his/her status, and befriend other users.
6. Premium Subscription
   - Integrate modern payment methods that allow users to buy premium subscriptions to have access to premium privileges.
   - A free user and a paid user will have different user interfaces with different features and support.
