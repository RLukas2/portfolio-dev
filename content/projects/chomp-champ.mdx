## Description

Chomp Champs is a 2D top-down action-survival game inspired by Feeding Frenzy, where you play as a hungry aquatic creature aiming to eat smaller prey, avoid larger predators, and grow into the apex of the food chain.
With simple controls and pixel-style visuals, the game delivers a fun, arcade-like experience while showcasing core Unity development techniques.

- **Hazards & Enemies**: Avoid predators and environmental dangers like mines or toxic jellyfish.
- **Pixel-Art Aesthetics**: Retro-inspired visuals with hand-crafted sprites and effects.
- **Multiple Levels**: Different aquatic environments with increasing difficulty.
- **Simple Controls**: Arrow keys or WASD to move, ESC to pause or return to menu.
- **Scene Management**: Seamless transition between Main Menu, Settings, Level Select, Shop, and Gameplay.
