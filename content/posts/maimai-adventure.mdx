## Introduction

**maimai** is a vibrant rhythm game developed by SEGA, known for its unique circular arcade cabinet and engaging gameplay.
Since its release in 2012, maimai has captivated players worldwide with its extensive music library, colorful visuals, and social features.

In this blog post, I'll share my personal journey with maimai, highlighting the aspects that make it a standout rhythm game.

## Discovering maimai

My friends first introduced me to maimai at 11st grade (it was 2021) when they asked me on Discord.
Curious, I decided to give it a try, and I was immediately hooked.
However, the distance from home to the arcade made me hesitant to play regularly.

It wasn't until there is an arcade in 2022, Lang Xi Trum (which is closed but transferred to Panda Game Center), near my high school that I started playing maimai more frequently.
The convenience of having an arcade nearby allowed me to immerse myself in the game and explore its features.

## 2022: First Steps

In 2022, I took my first steps into the world of maimai.
I started by playing the basic songs (well not actually basic difficulty) and gradually worked my way up to more challenging tracks.
The game's unique mechanics and technical patterns kept me engaged and motivated to improve my skills.

  </>
}

As I progressed, I began to appreciate the game's diverse music selection, which spans various genres and styles.
From J-pop to classical remixes, maimai offers something for every music lover.

Sometimes, me and my friends delve into the more challenging songs that we couldn't play well.
But it is fun to play and have fun rather than focusing on scores.

  </>
}

### First Tournament Participation

In July 2022, I and my friends participated in our first maimai tournament at Lang Xi Trum.
This experience was both thrilling and nerve-wracking, as we competed against other players and showcased our skills.
Although we lost in the first round, it was a valuable experience that fueled my passion for the game.

There were also many memorable moments during the tournament, such as meeting fellow maimai enthusiasts and memetics around the event.

### First Chunithm arrival in the South

In August 2022, Chunithm, another popular rhythm game by SEGA, arrived in the southern region of Vietnam.
The first machine arrival at Aeon Mall Tan Phu - Dream Games, where I first played maimai with my friends.

It was very far from my home, but I still went there to experience Chunithm for the first time.
Especially being the first player to play Chunithm in the South region.

  </>
}

And I managed to get a decent score on my first try!

}

### Experience at Aeon Mall Binh Tan

I also had the opportunity to visit Aeon Mall Binh Tan, where both maimai and Chunithm machines were available.
The arcade, Dream Games, where most of people said that the machines here were the best and well-maintained in Ho Chi Minh City.

  </>
}

In August 12, 2022, I managed to get my near **All Perfect** (AP-1) in maimai on the song "エンヴィーベイビー" (Envy Baby).
It is in Expert (9+), but still, it was a significant milestone for me.

    alt="First AP-1"

  />
}

Later that month, August 15, 2022, I got a near S (97%) score on the song "MAXRAGE" in Master (13+).

}

### Tuyu arrival to maimai

    alt="Tuyu update"
    width={750}
  />
  </>
}

One of the most exciting updates in maimai was the arrival of Tuyu, a popular Vocaloid producer.
They brought a fresh wave of music to the game, they are:

- "あの世行きのバスに乗ってさらば。" (I'm Getting on the Bus to the Other World, See Ya!)
- "くらべられっ子" (Comparing Child)
- "泥の分際で私だけの大切を奪おうだなんて" (Being low as dirt, taking what's important from me)

}

  />
  </>
}

### Cheesing Full Combo

Full Combo (FC) is a challenging feat in maimai, requiring players to hit every note without missing.
But cheesing FC is also a thing that many players do to achieve the satisfaction of FCing a song.
This often involves using specific techniques or helping from multiple players to "cheese" via spamming both buttons and screens instead of playing normally.

    width={750}
  />
  <figcaption className="text-center mt-0">Cheese FC by Truong Duc Minh</figcaption>
  </>
}

The time I experience it was on November 11, 2022, when one of player, Truong Duc Minh, asked us who are sitting waiting for our turn to help him cheese FC on "QZKago Requiem" in Re:Master (14+).

It was a fun experience, and we managed to achieve the FC together! But alas, it was really tiring since we have to spam both buttons and screens non-stop.

### Near SSS

I got a near SSS (99.9994%) on "larva" (Expert 13) on November 28, 2022.
This was also a FC-1 (i.e., Full Combo with one miss) for me.

## 2023: Continuing the Journey

### New Version: maimai FESTiVAL

I didn't play maimai much in early 2023 due to focusing on my studies.
However, I made a comeback with the release of maimai FESTiVAL in February 2023.
And this was easily one of the best versions of maimai yet!

Upon every new version release, maimai introduces a plethora of new songs, features, and improvements.
However, the rating that we have accumulated from previous versions will be reset.

<blockquote>
  maimai Rating works as there are 50 best songs that you have played, divided into 35 old songs (from previous versions) and 15 new songs (from the current version).

When a new version is released, the new songs portion will be reset, the new song will be transferred to old songs portion, and you have to play new songs to fill up the new songs portion again.

</blockquote>

  </>
}

### Road to 14000 Rating

Every player playing maimai always aims to reach a higher rating. Some want to reach 16000 - the GOAT rating, some want to reach 15000 - the elite rating, and some just want to reach 14000 - the respectable rating at that time.

For me, I aimed to reach 14000 rating first.
I reached 13900 rating on February 21, 2023, where I played one of the most tiring song, "デッドマンズバラッド" (Deadman's Ballad) in Master (14).

    alt="13900 rating"
    width={750}
  />
  <figcaption className="text-center mt-0">Reached 13900 rating</figcaption>
  </>
}

And I creep closer to my goal every day.

        imageUrl: '/media/blog/maimai-adventure/score_12.jpg',
      },
    ]}
  />
}

And finally, on February 28, 2023, I reached my goal of 14000 rating on the song "三妖精SAY YA!!!" (Three Fairies SAY YA!!!) in Master (13).
