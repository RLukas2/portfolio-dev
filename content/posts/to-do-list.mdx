# Website To-Do List

This is a living document tracking planned features and improvements for my personal portfolio.
I'll update this as I progress through each item.

## Get Started

I have long wanted to create a personal website that serves as a central hub for my work, projects, and blog posts.
My goal is to build a platform that is easy to navigate, visually appealing, and simple to maintain.
I am using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Supabase](https://supabase.com/), and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) to build this website, leveraging their powerful features to create a seamless user experience.

## Initial Setup

- [x] Set up Next.js project with TypeScript
- [x] Integrate Tailwind CSS for styling
- [x] Configure Supabase for backend services
- [x] Set up Prisma for database management
- [x] Implement authentication with Supabase Auth
- [x] Design and implement the database schema
- [x] Create initial pages: Home, About, Projects, Blog, Contact
- [x] Deploy the website on Vercel

One of the reasons I deploy on Vercel rather than Github Pages is the built-in support for serverless functions and API routes, which allows me to create a more dynamic and interactive experience for users.

Another reason is managing static and dynamic content more efficiently, as Vercel optimizes the delivery of both types of content seamlessly; meanwhile, Github Pages is primarily designed for static content.

## Why Improve?

As I continue to develop my website, I want to ensure that it remains up-to-date with the latest web development trends and technologies.
By continuously improving the website, I can provide a better user experience and showcase my skills as a developer.

And some of the aesthetic elements feel a bit outdated, not fit, or just plain boring.
That is why I want to keep pushing the boundaries and exploring new design trends to make my website more visually appealing.

## Priority Features

This is a list of features and improvements I plan to implement on my website, categorized by priority.

### General

This is the most important section, as it affects the overall functionality and user experience of the website.
Most of the priority features here are being worked on first before diving into specific pages.

#### Architecture & Performance

- [x] **Audit current codebase** for optimization opportunities
- [x] **Reduce bundle size** - code splitting, lazy loading
- [x] **Image optimization** - WebP, responsive images, lazy loading
- [x] **SEO optimization**
  - [x] Update meta tags/OG images for each page
  - [x] Add JSON-LD schema markup (BlogPosting, Person, Project)

- [ ] **Update all internal links** after URL changes

### Navigation Bar

I think the navigation bar could use some improvements to enhance usability and aesthetics?
But not sure what exactly yet.
Well, for now, it is completely functional and fine enough as is.

~~Until I figure out what to change or get some bug.~~

- Should I add "More" dropdown for secondary items?
- [ ] **Fix Command Palette** icon small on mobile.
- [x] **Add active link highlighting** to indicate the current page.

### Home Page

This is the main landing page for visitors to my website.
But it feels a bit bland and could use some sprucing up.

- [x] **Redesign the page** with updated graphics and text
- [ ] **Add year-end retrospective section**
  - [ ] Create `/retrospective` or `/recap` page
  - [ ] Display stats: posts written, projects shipped, skills learned
  - [ ] Add reflections on the year
  - [ ] Include link to previous years' recaps if available
- [ ] **Add endorsements showcase** (featured endorsements carousel/grid)
  - [ ] Show top 3-5 endorsements with avatar + quote
  - [ ] Link to full endorsements page
- [x] **Latest blog post preview** (single featured post, not list)
- [ ] **Newsletter/contact CTA** section
- [ ] **Animated hero section** with typing effect or subtle parallax
- [ ] **Quick stats bar** (X posts, Y projects, Z endorsements)
- [ ] **"Currently working on"** widget showing active project/learning

### About Page

I don't know if the about page needs much improvement, but I think it could use some updates to make it more engaging and informative.
Maybe reusing some of the components from the home page like the endorsements showcase.

- [ ] **Redesign the page** layout for better readability and engagement.
- **Update biography**:
  - [x] Introduction/Bio
  - [x] Experience/Background
  - [x] Skills/Technologies
  - [x] Interest/Hobbies
  - [x] Social Links
- [ ] **Add 'What I'm up to now' section** with current projects and interests.
- [ ] Maybe add the retrospective section here instead?
- [ ] **Timeline visualization** of career/education journey
- [ ] **Fun facts section** with interactive reveals
- [ ] **Downloadable resume** quick access button (already exists, verify visibility)
- [x] **Availability status** indicator (open for work/busy) - more prominent

### Resume Page

The resume page displays my professional experience and education in a timeline format.

- [x] **Create `Institution` interface** similar to `Company` for education entries
- [x] **Add optional accomplishments** field to education entries
- [x] **Create reusable `TimelineCard` component** for consistent styling
- [x] **Make timeline mobile-friendly** with inline icons
- [ ] **Add skills section** with visual progress bars or tag cloud
- [ ] **Add certifications section** if applicable
- [ ] **Print stylesheet** for resume page (clean print layout)
- [ ] **Export options** - Download as PDF, share link
- [ ] **Add "Currently learning" section** to show growth mindset

### Blog Page & Individual Blog Posts

One of the main sections of my website is the blog, where I share my thoughts and experiences on various topics related to web development, programming, and technology.

But I feel like the blog section could use some improvements to make it more engaging and user-friendly.
Since blogging is one of my main focuses, I want to ensure that this section of the website is top-notch.

#### Blog List Page

One of the main issues with the current blog list page is that it lacks advanced filtering options.
As the number of blog posts grows, it becomes increasingly difficult for users to find specific topics or categories of interest.

As such, I want to implement advanced filtering options that allow users to easily sort and filter blog posts based on their interests.

In the future, I may also want to consider adding pagination or infinite scroll to the blog list page to improve performance and user experience. And adding folder or category support to better organize blog posts.

- [x] **Add advanced filtering**
  - [x] Filter by category/tag
  - [x] Sort by date, popularity, reading time
  - [x] Search functionality (full-text search recommended)
- [x] **Improve blog card design**
  - [x] Show: title, excerpt, date, reading time, featured image
  - [x] Add category badges/tags
  - [ ] Show author info if applicable
- [x] **Add pagination or infinite scroll** (recommend pagination for UX)
- [ ] **Create category landing pages** (e.g., `/blog/category/nextjs`)
- [ ] **Add "popular posts" section** on blog homepage
- [ ] **Add Folder/Category**?
- [ ] **Archive view** - group posts by year/month

#### Individual Blog Post Page

The blog currently is plain and simple, but I think it could use some enhancements to improve readability and engagement.

- [x] **Add Table of Contents (ToC)**
  - [x] Auto-generate from H2/H3 headings
  - [x] Add sticky ToC sidebar (desktop) or collapsible (mobile)
  - [x] Implement smooth scroll anchors
  - [x] Highlight current section being read
- [x] **Redesign post layout**
  - [x] Better typography hierarchy
  - [x] Improved code block styling
  - [x] Better image presentation (lightbox modal?)
  - [x] Increase line-height for readability
- [x] **Add "Related Posts" section** at bottom
- [x] **Add last updated date**
- [ ] **Newsletter CTA** in post footer
- [ ] **Comments section** (consider Giscus/Utterances if using GitHub)

### Projects Page

The projects page showcases my work and side projects.
I want to make sure that this section is visually appealing and easy to navigate, allowing visitors to quickly find and learn more about my projects.

At least I make it people can visit individual project pages instead of just a list of projects.

- **Redesign project cards**:
  - [x] Make it as a list for Desktop and grid for Mobile
  - [x] Show: title, description, tech stack, links (GitHub/demo), image
  - [x] Add **View Details** button to each card that direct to each project posts
- [x] **Highlight featured projects** at top (pin top 3)
- [x] Add individual project pages with more details (use the same technology as blog posts?)

### Snippet Page

This is a page that I am using to share small code snippets or utilities that I find useful.

However, I want to make it bigger, via combining it into **Shorts**. That is, where I write small notes, tips, or what am I doing currently without having to write a full blog post.

- [x] **Rename "Snippets" to "Shorts"** in navigation
- [x] **Redesign Shorts page** to combine:
  - [x] Code snippets (reusable code)

  - [x] Filter by tag
  - [x] Sort by date, name, and views.

  - [x] Show title, description, code preview
  - [x] Tags
  - [ ] Copy button
  - [ ] View full short button
- [ ] **Share/export options**
- [ ] **Add Folders/Categories** for better organization?
- [ ] **Quick add** shortcut for logged-in admin (floating + button)
- [ ] **Syntax highlighting theme** options (match site theme)
- [ ] **Code playground** integration (run code in browser for simple snippets)

- [ ] **Request endorsement** - shareable link to send to colleagues
- [ ] **Thank you animation** after endorsing

### Guestbook Page

The guestbook allows visitors to leave messages and feedback.
Most of the time, I get messages via email or social media, but having a guestbook can be a fun way for visitors to interact directly on the site.

- [ ] **Add emoji reactions** to guestbook entries

- [ ] **Comparison tables** for similar tools
- [ ] **Cost indicator** (Free, Paid, Subscription)
- [ ] **Link to alternatives** I've tried

### Dashboard

Well, one of the page I see useful for myself is a dashboard where I can see some analytics about my website.
But it can also be useful for visitors to see some stats about my work.

Currently, it showing analytics about my website, WakaTime stats about my coding activity, and GitHub stats about my repositories.
But I think it deserves some improvements.

- [ ] **Suggest similar pages** based on the URL they tried to access
- [ ] **Add recent/popular posts** as navigation options
- [ ] **Interactive 404 animation** (mini-game, animation, or Easter egg)
- [ ] **Report broken link** button to notify admin
- [ ] **Error page illustrations** - custom artwork or animated SVGs
- [ ] **Maintain consistent branding** on error pages
- [ ] **Add humor/personality** while being helpful
